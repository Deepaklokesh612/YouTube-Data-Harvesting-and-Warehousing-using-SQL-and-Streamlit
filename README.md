# Introduction

The project about Building a simple dashboard or UI using Streamlit. The application facilitates the retrieval of various data points such as channel details, video information, playlists, and comments using the YouTube API. It also provides functionality to store this data in a MYSQL database (Warehousing) and query it for analysis the data within the Streamlit.

# Skills Takeaway 

Python scripting, Data Collection, Streamlit, API integration, Data Management using SQL.

# Approach
1. Set up a Streamlit app
2. Connect to the YouTube API
3. Store and Clean data
4. Migrate data to a SQL data warehouse
5. Query the SQL data warehouse
6. Display data in the Streamlit app


# Overview 

Data Harvesting: Utilizing the YouTube API to collect data such as video details, channel information, playlists, and comments.

Data Storage: Setting up a local MySQL database. Creating tables to store the harvested YouTube data. Using SQL scripts to insert the collected data into the database.

Data Analysis: Developing a Streamlit application to interact with the SQL database. Performing analysis on the stored YouTube data.

# Prerequisites

Before using the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
1. Python Environment: Install Python on your system.
